  abstract={A soft continuum manipulator with tunable stiffness can not only take advantage of high compliance for safe adaptation in unknown environments, but also circumvent the drawbacks of instability and low loading capability. The high nonlinearity of soft manipulators and the strong coupling between actuation and stiffness-tuning make their simultaneous control challenging. In this work, a novel approach to simultaneous control of actuation and stiffness-tuning is proposed for soft pneumatic manipulators. With a piecewise-constant curvature assumption, a Lagrangian-based dynamic model with realistic approximation is used for control design, where the dynamics of the stiffness-tunable mechanism is incorporated. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) is proposed to estimate unmeasurable states including the stiffness and the velocity. A nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework is developed first in the configuration space, and then extended to the task space, for simultaneous motion and stiffness control under inflation and vacuum pressure constraints. Simulation results are presented to support the efficacy of the proposed approach.},
