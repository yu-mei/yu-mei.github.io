I am a PhD student in the [Smart Microsystems Lab](https://smlab.msu.edu/) at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/), advised by [Dr. Xiaobo Tan](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~xbtan/) starting from 2021. Prior to joining MSU, I received my Bachelor degree in Robotics Engineering from the Department of Automation at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) in 2020, advised by [Dr. Aiguo Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RjQ5TrEAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research focuses on soft robotics, control systems and mechatronics, with an emphasis on soft actuator and sensor system design, as well as data-driven and learning-based modeling and control of robotic systems. 

I was recognized as an [ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Division (DSCD) Rising Star](https://sites.gatech.edu/mechatronics/dscdrisingstars/) in 2025. My work received the [Best Student Paper Award](https://smlab.msu.edu/news/yu-mei-received-aim-2025-best-student-paper-award/#:~:text=This%20work%2C%20%E2%80%9CSimultaneous%20shape%20reconstruction,Vaibhav%20Srivastava%2C%20and%20Xiaobo%20Tan.) at the IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM) in 2024, and the [Best Student Paper Finalist](https://mecc2025.a2c2.org/student-best-paper/) at the Modeling, Estimation and Control Conference (MECC) in 2025.
